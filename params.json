Check out scrapy [documentation](http://scrapy.org/) to understand how to write crawlers better. Scraped data are JSON formatted currently. You can define your own pipelines. Make sure to add your pipelines to ITEM_PIPELINES in settings.py. Define pipeline classes in <extracted-folder>/scrapBib/pipelines.py. \r\n\r\nAll UI related files are in <extracted-folder>/ui/. UI is written using the cool [Twitter bootstrap framework](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).\r\n\r\nscrapy server is assumed to run on 6800 port (default). If you are changing it, change it correspondingly in the curl request URLs in ui/fetchresults.php file too.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWant to report bugs/contribute ?
